- Go to `Customizations`, here you can set up `Global` and `Workspace` instructions and also add specific instruction files for different tasks.

- **Use rules from this prompt library as a base**: You can find ready-to-use AI rules in the [`rules/`](../rules/) directory of this repository. These rules can be:
  - Combined in one file and added as either Global or Workspace instructions depending on their scope
  - Used individually as instruction files for specific file types or development scenarios
  - Mixed and matched based on your project needs

**Custom Instructions**

- **Global Instructions**: Add rules that can be applicable for all projects you're working on. These are applied across all workspaces.
  
- **Workspace Instructions**: Add rules specific to the current project only. These are applied only to the current workspace. 

- **Instruction Files**: Use these for rules that should be applied in specific cases. For example:
  - Specific rules for writing `.twig` files or `.ts` files
  - For the prompt library, cypress-specific rules can be placed here
