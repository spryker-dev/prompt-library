# Cypress Boilerplate Test Development Rules

## Basic Principles

- Tests are deterministic, isolated, and readable.
- Interact via user-visible behavior; avoid implementation details.
- Prefer resilient, semantic selectors over brittle DOM selectors.
- If it exists in the current repository, read and apply Test Writing Conventions 
- Top-level describe matches user story/feature; it states a clear behavior.

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names: Names should be self-explanatory and describe the purpose or function of the variable, function, or file.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: Start with a lowercase letter and capitalize each subsequent word (e.g., myVariable, getUserName).
- Use PascalCase for classes and constructors: Start with an uppercase letter and capitalize each subsequent word (e.g., UserService, OrderProcessor).
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names: Use lowercase letters separated by hyphens (e.g., user-service.ts, order-processor.ts).
- Avoid abbreviations: Use full words to avoid confusion (e.g., authentication instead of auth).

## Project Structure
- Test specs, page objects, scenarios and commands should be logically separated into subfolders based on the business feature they belong to
- Complex reusable actions that use more than one application page SHOULD be created as Scenarios in `cypress/support/scenarios`

### Folder Structure:
```
cypress/
  e2e/                  # container for  test specifications
    backoffice/         # specifications *.cy.ts that test backoffice features are grouped here, further subdivided into folders by features
    glue/               # specifications *.cy.ts that test Glue API features are grouped here, further subdivided into folders by features
    merchant-portal/    # specifications *.cy.ts that test Merchant Portal features are grouped here, further subdivided into folders by features
    storefront/         #specifications *.cy.ts that test Storefront features are grouped here, further subdivided into folders by features
  fixtures/             # typed JSON fixtures that store test data
  support/
    cy-commands/        # *.ts files with custom commands
    glue-endpoints/     # *.ts files each of which contains ulrs, payload, test data references and headers for one specific API endpoint that can be reused inside a test
    page-objects/       # *.ts files each of which contains a page object - selectors and actions that are limited to a single application page
    scenarios/          # *.ts files that contain complex reusable scenarios that involve more than one page object page
    e2e.ts              # global setup, test libs
    index.d.ts          # TS augmentation for Cypress
```

## TypeScript & Config

- For TS config use existing `tsconfig.json`
- For Cypress config use existing `cypress.config.ts`
- for E2E config use existing `cypress/support/e2e.ts`

## Selectors & Page Objects

- MUST use one of these attributes for element selection when available: id, name, data-qa
- All selectors that belong to one application page and methods that use them MUST be created inside the relevant page object
- Each application page MUST exist as a separate page object in cypress/support/page-objects
- Stub external/unstable requests with cy.intercept; avoid real third-party calls in CI.

## Flake Prevention
- Hardcoded wait times MUST NOT be used in tests to improve reliability and reduce flakiness - DO NOT use `cy.wait()` where it can be avoided.
- Wait on app signals: cy.wait('@alias'), element state (should('be.visible')), route changes, toasts.
- Use Cypressâ€™ retry ability; avoid extracting values out of the chain unless necessary.

## Fixtures & Test Data
- Test data MUST be specified in cypress/fixtures
- Test data MUST NOT be hardcoded inside the test
- Never commit secrets; use Cypress.env().

## Assertions
- Test assertions MUST be kept short, and concise, and verifying a single specific business case.
- Prefer semantic assertions tied to user-observable behavior.
- One assertion focus per test; extra assertions must support the same behavior.
- Assert on toast/alert error messages when simulating failures.

## Test Structure

- Use beforeEach for common preconditions (routes, auth, seed).
- Avoid using After and afterEach - cleaning state and other activities are better to do in before sections
- Keep tests independent; no shared mutable state across tests.
