# Spryker Prompt Library

Welcome to the Spryker Prompt Library! This is a shared knowledge base of **proven and reusable prompts** to accelerate your development workflows using AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurfe, and more.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This library helps engineering teams:
- Write better code faster with AI tools.
- Share best practices across projects.
- Keep prompt knowledge centralized and searchable.
- Reduce repeated prompt crafting.

## Structure

Prompts are grouped by domain (feel free to introduce a new domain if needed):

| Category        | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `ai-coding-assistants/` | Prompts for Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. |
| `code-review/`          | Automated review and suggestions   |
| `documentation/`        | Docs and comment generation        |
| `testing/`              | Generating unit, integration, E2E tests |
| `templates/`            | Reusable prompt scaffolds          |

Each file contains:
- Prompt
- Context / When to use
- Example output
- Author (optional)
