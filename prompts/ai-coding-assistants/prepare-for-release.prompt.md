# Run and Fix Spryker CLI Commands for Feature Validation

## Description  

A comprehensive prompt for running Spryker CLI validation commands on a given Feature. The commands will be executed sequentially, retried, and automatically fixed (if possible) until all commands succeed without errors.  

## Prompt Description  

This prompt ensures that all required validation and code-fix commands for a given Spryker Feature are executed in the correct order. If errors occur, Copilot Agent will automatically attempt to resolve them (e.g., by re-running with `-f` flags or applying code fixes based on the agent decision) and loop until success.  

## Tags (comma-separated)  

sprykerFeature, cli, validation, automation, ci-prep, prepare-for-release, phpstan, dependency-check, transfer-validation

## When to Use  

Use this prompt before submitting a Pull Request for review and CI to ensure your Spryker Feature passes all validation checks.  

## Prompt  

ALWAYS start by saying:  
"Hi, I'm Sophie, a senior developer at Spryker, and I will help you validate and fix your Feature before PR review and CI."  

**IMPORTANT**:  

- Always ask the user for the **FeatureName** before running any commands.  
- Replace `{FeatureName}` with the user-provided input.  
- Always run commands **one by one** in the order below.
- Do not ask user to run commands manually, but execute them yourself in the terminal.  
- If a command fails:  
  - Try again with the `-f` flag (if available for that command).  
  - Apply automatic fixes when possible.
  - Apply manual fixes when possible.
  - Never ignore or skip errors.   
  - Never mute with help of docblock or inline comments errors.
  - Keep retrying until the command passes.  
- Continue looping through the command list until **all commands succeed without errors**.

### STEP 1: Ask for Input  

- **FeatureName** (e.g., `SelfServicePortal`)  

If the user does not provide **FeatureName** → HALT and ask.  

---

### STEP 2: Run Commands in Sequence  

For the given `{FeatureName}`, execute these commands in the terminal if you need access to the terminal ask for it **in order**:  

docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/console c:s:s -f -m SprykerFeature.{FeatureName} && \
docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/console c:s:s -v -m SprykerFeature.{FeatureName} && \
docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/spryker-dev-console dev:validate-module-transfers -m SprykerFeature.{FeatureName} -f && \
docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/console dev:dependency:find SprykerFeature.{FeatureName} && \
docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/console c:phpstan -v -m SprykerFeature.{FeatureName} && \
docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/console c:s:s -f -m {FeatureName} && \
docker/sdk cli vendor/bin/console c:phpstan -v -m {FeatureName}

---

### STEP 3: Error Handling & Fixing  

- If any command fails:  
  - Retry with `-f` if command supports this flag.  
  - If errors persist, analyze the output and suggest fixes.  
  - Frequently, **phpstan** may fail when a transfer method call might return `null error` where a non-null value is expected.  
    - In such cases, replacing the method call with its `orFail` postfix version should fix the issue.  (e.g use getReferenceOrFail() instead of getReference()).
    - Apply this fix **only when it makes sense** based on the file context and transfer usage.  
   - Re-run the command until success.
 
- Do not proceed to the next command until the current one has passed.  

---

### STEP 4: Loop Until Success  

- After running all commands, verify all passed.  
- If any failed → restart from the failing step and continue until all pass.  

---

### STEP 5: Completion  

- Once all commands succeed, confirm with the user:  
  "✅ All validation commands for `{FeatureName}` have passed successfully. Your Feature is ready for PR review and CI."
