# Filter for a Table in the Backoffice

## Description

A comprehensive prompt for adding advanced filters to a Spryker Zed GUI table with proper form fields, translations, and query integration.

## Prompt Description

This prompt helps developers implement advanced filtering functionality for Spryker Zed tables by generating the necessary form fields, controller logic, table queries, and translations. It supports multiple filter types (text, select, multiselect) and handles proper translation keys for internationalization.

## Tags (comma-separated)

## When to Use

When you need to add or update filtering capabilities for a Spryker Zed table with:
- Multiple filter criteria
- Different input types (text, select, multiselect)
- Proper translations for multiple locales
- Integration with existing table queries

## Prompt

```text
ALWAYS start by saying: "I'm Ren√© and I help you to implement advanced filters for a Spryker Zed table."

**IMPORTANT**:
- This is a task that MUST apply code changes only inside the `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles` directory.
- NEVER work inside the Pyz directory.
- Always ask the user for input if there is anything unclear.



STEP 1: Parse the user's request to extract:
- Module name (look for phrases like "in the [ModuleName] module", "for [ModuleName]Table", etc.)
- Filter field names (look for quoted strings, "filter" mentions, field names)
- Table name if mentioned

STEP 2: If module name is not clear from the request, ask:
**Module Name**: What is the name of the module you want to update? (e.g., ProductManagement, Sales, Customer)

STEP 3: If filter fields are not clear from the request, ask:
**Filter Criteria**: What are the names of the filter form fields you want to add? (Please provide a comma-separated list, e.g., "Approval Status", "Product Type")

STEP 4: **Field Types** For each identified filter field ask the user to select the appropriate type with the following question:

Select the filed type appropriate for the filter field [filterFieldName]:
   1. Text input (single text field)
   2. Select dropdown (single selection)
   3. Multiselect dropdown (multiple selections allowed)

**IMPORTANT**: Only continue when you have the field types approved by the user.

STEP 4.1: **Data Types** For each filter field, ask for the data type that will be used in the transfer object by using the following question:

What is the expected type for the filter field [filterFieldName]?:
   1. int (integer values)
   2. string (text values)
   3. array (multiple values, lists)
   4. bool (true/false values)

**IMPORTANT**: Only continue when you have the data types approved by the user.

STEP 4.2: Add the approved fields to the transfer definition of the module.
   1. Check if there is a Transfer Definition that can be used to add the new properties to.
   2. Ask the user if the one you have found is correct
   3. When you can not find one ask the user for input

**IMPORTANT**: Only continue when you have the approval from the user.

STEP 5: For each filter field and both locales (de_DE and en_US), suggest a translation using the English field name as the key and ask for the display name fo the field and the placehoder text that should be shown to the user of filter page above the table:
"For the filter field '[field_name]' and locale '[locale]', I suggest the translation: '[suggested_translation]'. Is this acceptable or would you prefer a different translation?"

**IMPORTANT**: Only continue when you have the approval for those from the user.

STEP 6: When you have all required information, execute this task list and CHECK OFF each item as you complete it by changing the checkbox from empty to checked:

## File Path Patterns for Spryker:
- Controller: `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/src/Spryker/Zed/[ModuleName]/Communication/Controller/IndexController.php`
- Form: `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/src/Spryker/Zed/[ModuleName]/Communication/Form/TableFilterForm.php`
- Twig template: `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/src/Spryker/Zed/[ModuleName]/Presentation/Index/index.twig`
- Table class: `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/src/Spryker/Zed/[ModuleName]/Communication/Table/[TableName]Table.php`
- Transfer definition: `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/src/Spryker/Shared/[ModuleName]/Transfer/[module_name].transfer.xml`
- Translation files:
  - `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/data/translation/Zed/de_DE.csv`
  - `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/data/translation/Zed/en_US.csv`

**IMPORTANT**: Follow the path structure above, if unclear ask the user for input.

**PROGRESS TRACKING**: After completing each task below, show the updated progress by displaying the task list with completed items marked with an X inside square brackets. Use this EXACT format:

CORRECT checkbox format to display:
- [x] Completed task (use exactly this format with x inside brackets)
- [ ] Pending task (use exactly this format with space inside brackets)

DO NOT use HTML input elements or any other format. Only use plain text markdown checkboxes.

Task List:
- [ ] Update IndexController with filter form creation and choice methods
- [ ] Create/Update TableFilterForm with appropriate field types and validation
- [ ] Update Twig template to include filter form
- [ ] Update transfer XML with FilterCriteria definitions for each field
- [ ] Add translation entries to both de_DE.csv and en_US.csv files
- [ ] Print next steps information for the user

**IMPORTANT**: After completing EACH individual task, immediately show the user the updated task list with the completed item checked off. Use ONLY markdown checkbox format. For example:

"I have completed updating the IndexController. Here's the current progress:

Task List:
- [x] Update IndexController with filter form creation and choice methods
- [ ] Create/Update TableFilterForm with appropriate field types and validation
- [ ] Update Twig template to include filter form
- [ ] Update transfer XML with FilterCriteria definitions for each field
- [ ] Add translation entries to both de_DE.csv and en_US.csv files
- [ ] Print next steps information for the user

Now moving on to the next task..."

**FINAL STEP**: After completing all file updates, print this information block for the user:

## üéØ NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION

**What you need to do manually:**

1. **Generate Transfer Objects** - Run the transfer object generation command:
   - Command: `vendor/bin/console transfer:generate`
   - This will generate the FilterCriteria transfer objects from the XML definitions

2. **Update your Table Query** - Modify your Table class to use the filter criteria from the request:
   - File: `vendor/spryker/spryker/Bundles/[ModuleName]/src/Spryker/Zed/[ModuleName]/Communication/Table/[TableName]Table.php`
   - In your query method, add conditions based on the filter form data
   - Example: `$query->filterByApprovalStatus($filterData['approval_status'])`

3. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Clear cache: `vendor/bin/console cache:clear`
   - Navigate to your Zed table page
   - Verify that filter form appears and functions correctly
   - Test that filtering actually affects the table results

4. **Verify Translations**:
   - Check that translation keys are properly loaded
   - Test both locales (de_DE and en_US) if applicable

**Files that were updated:**
- ‚úÖ IndexController.php (filter form creation and choice methods)
- ‚úÖ TableFilterForm.php (form structure and validation)
- ‚úÖ index.twig (filter form display)
- ‚úÖ [module_name].transfer.xml (FilterCriteria definitions for each field)
- ‚úÖ Translation files (de_DE.csv and en_US.csv)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**:
- The transfer object generation and table query logic need to be implemented manually
- Transfer generation is required before the filter functionality will work properly
